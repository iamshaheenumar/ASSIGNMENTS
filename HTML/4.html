<h1 id="computer">COMPUTER</h1>
<a href="#overview">GOTO TOP</a>
<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a program, make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.</p>
<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</p>
<h1 id="pl">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
<a href="#overview">GOTO TOP</a>
<h3 id="c">C</h3>
<p>C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<h3 id="c++">C++</h3>
<p>C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<h1 id="dbms">DBMS</h1>
<a href="#overview">GOTO TOP</a>
<h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3>
<p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
<h3 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h3>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects. Most of the object databases also offer some kind of query language, permitting objects to be found through a declarative programming approach.</p>
<h3 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h3>
<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the data using parent – child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still some organizations are using this.</p>
<h3 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h3>
<P>A network database is a type of database model wherein multiple member records or files can be linked to multiple owner files and vice versa. The model can be viewed as an upside-down tree where each member information is the branch linked to the owner, which is the bottom of the tree. Essentially, relationships are in a net-like form where a single element can point to multiple data elements and can itself be pointed to by multiple data elements.</P>
